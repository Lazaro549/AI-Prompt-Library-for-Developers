# AI Prompt Library for Developers

A curated collection of high-quality AI prompts designed specifically for software developers — to assist with coding tasks, architecture decisions, documentation, debugging, research, and more.

This repository serves as a **centralized prompt library** where developers can find, use, and contribute prompts that work well with modern large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT models, Claude, Gemini, and other AI assistants. Prompts are organized into categories and formatted for easy reuse.

## 📌 Why This Library

AI has become a powerful tool for developers to accelerate everyday tasks. But using AI effectively often depends on having well-designed prompts that elicit the *right* responses. This library aims to:

- 💡 Save time with ready-to-use prompts  
- 📚 Organize prompts by developer use cases  
- 🤝 Enable community contributions  
- 🚀 Help developers get reliable results from LLMs

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each category contains Markdown files with prompts and usage details:
```
├── 🧠 prompt-engineering/ # Prompts for creating better prompts
├── 💻 coding/ # Development & coding helper prompts
├── 🛠️ tools/ # Prompts for tooling, automation, testing
├── 📄 documentation/ # Prompts to assist with docs & READMEs
├── 📊 research/ # Prompts for data analysis and research
├── 📎 examples/ # Example outputs & real use cases

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Browse Prompts

Explore prompts by category — pick one that fits your scenario.

Example:

```markdown
## Generate Unit Test Cases

**Prompt:**  
Provide a set of comprehensive unit tests in Jest for the following function:

**Input:**  
```js
function sum(a, b) { return a + b }

```

### Use a Prompt

Copy the prompt text from this library and paste it into your AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.). Replace any placeholders with your own code or context.

### Customize

Adapt prompts to your project’s structure or language for better results. Prompts are not one-size-fits-all — tweak them as necessary!
